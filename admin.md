# Admin

The challenge in this case is how to transmit Administrative commands to a specific node. Sending the command to "_SLP", "_RST", or "_AYT" can simply be placed in our current notecards ASCII. The leading underscore could signify and administrative command, with the following capital letters being the ugly abbreviation for these commands. To get the message to the correct node is more complex, but to keep our prior functionality we will again use the idea of Student ID number. We have to assume that the sender either has some idea of their target nodes ID, or that this information is easily accessible in some other way (like name and ID are searchable in student directory). The other option would be to have nodes mindlessly passing the cards untill a node saw their own ID, which is far from optimal in a room of 35.
