# Anti-Duplication 
In order to prevent a card from being read multiple times, we must process them in some way when they are recieved for the first time. A simple way to do this from a physical perspective would be to fold a card when recieved. This makes it very clear that the information was processed, but keeps the data in tact for any needed future reference. Similarly, a small "X" could be drawn in front of the ASCII block. This is basically the equivolant of a read receipt on a text message or email, which prevents the user (or node) from wasting time processing information twice.
